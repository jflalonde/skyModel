% function M = getTurbidityMapping(channelId)
%  Returns the turbidity mapping between turbidity and the constants
%  (a,b,c,d,e) from the Perez sky model. Taken from [Preetham et al., SISGGRAPH '99].
% 
% Input parameters:
%  - channelId: [1,3] channel in the xyY space
%
% Output parameters:
%  - M: turbidity mapping. [a b c d e] = M*[T 1]'
